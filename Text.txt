Hello friends, we have a project of not letting the legacy version die, even though renato never publish the project as open source ... Only the HEBorn version ...
We've played this game for years, and we want it to show our kids in the future, not just prints, but working.

If you know anything about javascript or nodejs, or even just want to help capture the entire frontend, join us at https://github.com/HECommunity
Once we capture the frontend and finish the most of the backend, we'll put the game online and up and running at https://hackerexperience.xyz

The frontend will be hosted on github pages, and the backend will run on an instance in amazon aws free tier. Communication with the backend probably we will do in javascript. PHP will not be used because it is slow, and it is not scalable.

We do not want to have many users, just a few nostalgic users, but why the project is open source, other people can run their own servers with their own modifications and build the game they always wanted.

In the future we want to be the first to run an alternate HE2 server for those who can not afford the license to play on the official server.

Thanks for reading.
